        "We import *FastAPI* class from fastapi module and create its object that we call, *app*. We also create a route with @app.route('/index') decorator which is linked with the async *home()* method. *async* acts as a modifier to make the function execute asynchronously. The local FastAPI server runs at port number 8000 and ngrok creates a tunnel so that outside networks can also access it as described earlier in the flask server implementation. Since FastAPI supports async calls we need a ASGI server i.e. uvicorn which runs the app at port number 8000 locally."
